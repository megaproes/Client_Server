# Client_Server
This is a C++ client-server application that uses the Command-pattern for interaction. 

To allow communication, the local port needs to be allowed through the firewall on both the server and client sides. 

The server creates a listening socket and handles incoming client connections. Users can send messages to the server. 

The project requires CMake to build.
